    <li>Who Am I?</li>
    <li><p>HEY! Let me tell you about myself, my name is Luis Garcia founder of the GL Clothing Company. In 2017, I started with a vision in mind to build a company that focuses in simple but high quality products. Lots of hard work and dedication has been poured into this project to make sure that our clients get the best experience when they shop with us.</p></li>
    <li>What Do I Do</li>
    <li><p>Well that depends, I attend college during the day pursuing a degree in Business Administration and I become a freelancer during the night. I focus in marketing, graphic design, web design, and branding. I've been able to expand my skills thanks to West Hills College Lemoore and Bitwise Industries, as a student for life I'm always seeking for knowledge.</p></li>
